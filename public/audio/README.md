Add retro-inspired WAV files that match these names to enable in-game audio cues. Each clip should be short (under 3 seconds), normalized to avoid clipping, and exported at 44.1 kHz.

- game_start.wav — plays when a round begins from the title screen or after pressing Play Again.
- ui_select.wav — shared click used for menu toggles, dialog buttons, and other UI confirmations.
- card_pickup.wav — fires the moment a player selects the first card of a swap.
- card_place.wav — completes the swap animation as the second card is chosen.
- success.wav — celebratory sting triggered when the player finishes with a perfect order or submits successfully.
- error.wav — alert tone for incorrect or time-out endings, and other negative feedback moments.

Replace this note once the final assets are committed.
